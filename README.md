[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HubSpot/NioSmtpClient.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/HubSpot/NioSmtpClient)


## Pre-ALPHA

Note that this project is currently under development.
Please do not try to use this in its current form.

## Dependencies

This project depends on Java8 and Netty 4.1.8

## Java Docs

See http://github.hubspot.com/NioSmtpClient/0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/

## Maven

Note that we haven't published anything yet since we're in active
development. When we do, the first version will be:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.hubspot</groupId>
  <artifactId>NioSmtpClient</groupId>
  <version>0.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```


## Notes For Developers

- NEVER execute blocking commands on an eventloop thread (i.e. `CountDownLatch.await` or `Future.get`)
- Avoid doing long running tasks on event loop threads
- Use `new` as sparingly as possible:
  - Share objects when possible
  - Use Netty ByteBuf allocators when possible

## Usage
```java
AsyncEmailClient asyncEmailClient = new AsyncEmailClient("domain.com",
                                                    "host.com",
                                                    "test",
                                                    "test",
                                                    25,
                                                    10000);
MimeMessage mimeMessage = new MessageBuilder(asyncEmailClient)
                .addTo("to@host.com")
                .setFrom("from@host.com")
                .setSubject("test mail")
                .setText("Hello world")
                .getMimeMessage();
asyncEmailClient.send(mimeMessage);
```
